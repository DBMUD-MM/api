# Crewmeister API swagger documentation


## How to edit?

Just update the swagger.yaml in a text editor.

To have a convenient preview of the result, you can use:
* The following plugin if you use VS Code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arjun.swagger-viewer. Open the `swagger.yaml` and press `Shift + Alt + P` (for preview)
* An online editor in the browser: https://editor.swagger.io/. Copy the `swagger.yaml`, paste it in the browser, and after editing, paste the result back into the `swagger.yaml` from the repo
