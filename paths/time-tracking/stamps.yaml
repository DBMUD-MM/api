  summary: Time tracking stamps
  description: |
    The stamps endpoint responds information about the raw/unweighted time trackings of a given crew. Stamps containing the same *clockInTimestamp* attribute belong to one *stamp-chain*.
  parameters:
    - name: crew_id
      in: path
      type: integer
      required: true
    - name: startTime
      in: query
      description: Start time from where the stamps should be fetched.
      required: false
      type: string
      format: time
    - name: endTime
      in: query
      description: End time from where the stamps should be fetched.
      required: false
      type: string
      format: time
    - name: userIds
      in: query
      description: A comma seperated list of user_ids which should be filtered. If parameter is missing this filter won't be applied.
      required: false
      type: string
      format: comma-separated-list
    - name: timestamp
      in: query

        Warning! This parameter might change it's behaviour in the future. (Use startTime == endTime == date to get a chain of stamps for a point in time)
        In the early days of crewmeister it was possible to have multiple overlapping work time periods at the same time. In some cases this leads to unexpected behaviour. If one wants to render the current work time status (eg. mini-app) and there are overlapping work time periods the client doesn't know which one to pick. In this case the one period with a stop work stamp will overrule all other work time periods for the given timestamp.
      required: false
      type: boolean
    - name: starts_in_range
      in: query
      required: false
      type: boolean

        Is an optional parameter (default is false) which determines wether to include stamps which start in or are relevant to the given timerange. The following chart will explain the differentiation.
